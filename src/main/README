
OBS! UPDATED MANUALLY ALL CLASSES FROM "MyGraphProj->XYG_STATS" on [2021-04-21]
So manually means - i copied from "MyGraphProj->XYG_STATS" and placed in "MCLabStats->main"
and then manually corrected wrong imports etc..
IT SEEMS THAT BY [2021-04-21] the "MyGraphProj->XYG_STATS" and "MCLabStats->main" are almost
perfectly suited to each other - so copying can be done without problems


_M = means a Class adopted and/or used for "MCLabStats" project only

_RS = Should replace the Super Class in future

_HG = Histogram Graph (is the "bar" graph)

_PG = Polygon Graph (is the graph with the points)


DEMO -> Look in "Main" -> Constructor
