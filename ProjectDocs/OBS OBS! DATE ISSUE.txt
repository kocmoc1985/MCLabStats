Take a look at the "ResultN" view it's very important in which format it works with the field "test" testdate.

Example from Fedmog:
First in "ResultN" view we had it like: CONVERT(nchar, dbo.Result.TestDate, 104) AS testdate - which made that it was processed as a "String" and not as "Datetime"
Then it was changed to: FORMAT(dbo.Result.TestDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS testdate - this is correct, but remember that it works for MSSQL older then 2012

Also remember that you have to change the date format in the Java application to. Look in Main.class -> DATE_FORMAT.variable
