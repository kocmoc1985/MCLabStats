LOOK AT: Main.class:

public static final boolean MY_SQL = false;
public final static boolean DEMO_MODE = false;

DONT FORGET "javasysmon-0.3.3.jar" it is used now -> 2018-11-21

Check the "resultsn_name" propertie in the "main.properties"

SINCE[2020-06-09]
It's possible to show predefined quality/testcode/testname directly at startup. There are 4 properties for this purpose:
show_at_start=true
show_at_start_quality=**-0-0105*
show_at_start_testcode=17000
show_at_start_testname=MH

OBS! OBS! ALSO Check "ResultN" View -> CONVERT(nchar, dbo.Result.TestDate, 104) AS testdate -> having it like that makes that comparing dates fails.
This is correct: "dbo.Result.TestDate AS testdate"
