LOOK AT: Main.class:

public static final boolean MY_SQL = false;
public final static boolean DEMO_MODE = false;

DONT FORGET "javasysmon-0.3.3.jar" it is used now -> 2018-11-21

OBS! OBS! ALSO Check "ResultN" View -> CONVERT(nchar, dbo.Result.TestDate, 104) AS testdate -> having it like that makes that comparing dates fails.
This is correct: "dbo.Result.TestDate AS testdate"
